    "# Model Debugging, Inspection, and Modularization\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've focused on building and training models. \n",
    "But in the real world, your first attempt at a model rarely works perfectly. \n",
    "You'll often encounter cryptic error messages about mismatched tensor shapes, or worse, your model will run without errors but fail to produce meaningful results. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **debugging, inspection, and modularization** become essential skills. \n",
    "In this lab, you'll step into the role of a model investigator. \n",
    "You'll start with a broken Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and use systematic debugging techniques to find and fix the bug. Then, you'll learn how to refactor your code for clarity and reuse, and finally, you'll dissect a complex, pre-trained model to understand its inner workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Debug** a broken CNN by inserting print statements into the `forward` pass to identify and correct a critical tensor shape mismatch.\n",
    "* **Refactor** the corrected model using `nn.Sequential` to create a cleaner, more modular, and less error-prone architecture.\n",
    "* **Inspect** the activation statistics of your model to perform a sanity check for issues like exploding or vanishing gradients.\n",
    "* **Explore** the architecture of a complex, pre-existing model (`SqueezeNet`) to count its layers and analyze its parameter distribution."

    "To debug and inspect a model effectively, you'll first need a dataset to work with.\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to practice an end-to-end debugging and inspection workflow, so you'll use a simple dataset that lets you focus on the model architecture rather than complex data preprocessing.\n",
    "For this purpose, you'll use the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of clothing items and serves as a straightforward benchmark for image classification tasks.\n",
    "You’ll begin by loading the dataset using PyTorch’s torchvision library, and then create a DataLoader to efficiently handle the data in batches during training and evaluation."
