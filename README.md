# Deep Learning with PyTorch

[![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-%23EE4C2C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white)](https://pytorch.org/)

A hands-on repository for learning and implementing **Deep Learning** concepts using **PyTorch**.  
This project includes Jupyter notebooks for practical experiments, modular source code, and everything you need to get started with modern deep learning.

Perfect for beginners transitioning to PyTorch, intermediate learners building real models, or anyone exploring neural networks from scratch.

## 🚀 Features

- Practical Jupyter notebooks covering core concepts (97% of the codebase)
- Clean, modular Python source code in `src/`
- Ready-to-use `requirements.txt` for quick setup
- Step-by-step implementations of popular architectures and techniques

## 📚 Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

- `src/` → Reusable Python modules and utilities
- Jupyter Notebooks (root or subfolders) → Interactive tutorials and experiments on:
  - Tensors and Autograd
  - Building Neural Networks with `nn.Module`
  - Training loops and optimizers
  - CNNs for image classification
  - And more!

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitvermaknw/deep-learning-with-pytorch.git
   cd deep-learning-with-pytorch

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab

## ▶️ Usage

Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially.  
Each notebook is designed to be **self-contained**, with explanations, code, and exercises.

You are encouraged to:
- Modify the code in the `src/` directory
- Import and reuse it inside your notebooks for experimentation

## 📖 Learning Path Suggestion

Start with the basic notebooks and progress step by step:

1. **Introduction to PyTorch Tensors**
2. **Autograd and Backpropagation**
3. **Building Simple Neural Networks**
4. **MNIST / CIFAR-10 Classification**
5. **Advanced Topics**  
   *(GANs, Transformers, etc. — as they are added)*

This progression helps build strong fundamentals before moving into advanced deep learning concepts.

Happy learning and building! 🚀
